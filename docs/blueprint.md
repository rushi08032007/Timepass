# **App Name**: Code Duel

## Core Features:

- Set Code - Player 1: Player 1 sets a secret 3-digit code, with no repeated digits.
- Set Code - Player 2: Player 2 sets a secret 3-digit code, with no repeated digits.
- Submit Guess: Input and submit guess.
- Provide Feedback: Compare the guess against the opponent's code and provide feedback on correct digits and their positions.  Display number of guesses remaining.
- Versus AI: AI opponent sets code; AI uses tool to compare user guess to secret code, and provide feedback to user. Limited number of guesses allowed. End game and declare winner if user runs out of guesses.
- Indicate Win/Loss: Indicate win or loss based on correct guess or exhaustion of attempts

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong purple (#9D4EDD) to suggest intelligence and strategy.
- Background color: Soft lavender (#E9D5FF), visibly close to the primary color's hue, but heavily desaturated and light, ensuring a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#2D6A4F), approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' on the color wheel, significantly different from the primary in brightness and saturation to create a distinct contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of text; 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use minimalist icons for numbers and game actions (e.g., submit, reset).
- Divide the screen into clear sections for code input, feedback display, and game status (guesses remaining).
- Use subtle animations for feedback highlights and game transitions (e.g., win/loss).
